# Applied AI Innovation & Research Enablement (AIRE) Program

The Applied AI Innovation & Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is an institutional initiative supported by the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. The program provides a coordinated set of resources that help faculty, staff, researchers, and students explore and adopt artificial intelligence in ways that are responsible, evidence-informed, and aligned with academic values.

AIRE combines three complementary pillars that together support learning, experimentation, and decision intelligence:

**Applied AI Literacy Hub**  
Teaching-ready microcourses, tutorials, and foundational materials that help non-technical audiences build practical, discipline-aware AI literacy. The Hub introduces core concepts, supports responsible use in classrooms and advising, and provides learning pathways grounded in accessibility and ethical practice.

**Researcher Sandbox**  
A reproducible, method-focused environment—originally deployed in the college’s internal GitLab—where researchers and graduate students can explore AI-enabled workflows. Colab-ready notebooks demonstrate techniques such as OCR, entity recognition, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation, and evaluation patterns that can be adapted to diverse research contexts.

**Program Impact Dashboard**  
An institutional analytics layer that models participation patterns, confidence shifts, readiness indicators, and program KPIs using synthetic datasets that mirror internal structures. The dashboard, originally deployed on internal MSU web services, supports leadership planning, professional development strategy, and continuous evaluation of responsible AI adoption.

These public repositories are mirrors of the internally deployed versions, shared to support transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, and alignment with community standards for responsible AI integration in education and research. All examples use synthetic data only, and no institutional, student, or research data is included.

## Deployment History

The AIRE Program was originally developed and deployed across internal systems within the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. The program’s components—literacy resources, research workflows, and institutional analytics—were designed to operate within the college’s existing data governance, instructional support, and research computing infrastructure.

**Internal Deployments Included:**

- **AIRE Literacy Hub**  
  Hosted on college-managed web services and integrated with faculty development programming, course design support, and internal training pathways.

- **AIRE Researcher Sandbox**  
  Deployed on the college’s internal GitLab environment with secured access for research teams and graduate students. This environment provided reproducible notebooks, controlled experimentation spaces, and research governance guidelines aligned with institutional policy.

- **AIRE Impact Dashboard**  
  Operated on internal MSU web infrastructure, using authenticated access and institutionally governed datasets. Leadership, department chairs, and instructional support units used the dashboard to interpret participation patterns, confidence changes, readiness indicators, and emerging training needs.

**Purpose of the Public Mirrors**

These GitHub repositories represent public mirrors of the internal deployments.  
They make it possible for external partners and other institutions to:

- review the program’s architecture and documentation,  
- examine synthetic-data-based examples of AI literacy analytics,  
- explore reproducible research workflows in a safe environment,  
- adapt governance patterns and instructional models to their own contexts.

All public examples use synthetic data exclusively.  
No institutional, student, or research data from MSU is included in these mirrors.

## Repositories

### **AIRE Researcher Sandbox**  
[`aire-researcher-sandbox`](https://github.com/aire-program/aire-researcher-sandbox)  
Reproducible Jupyter workflows and Colab-ready modules demonstrating AI-enabled research techniques, documentation patterns, and governance-aligned experimentation practices.

### **AIRE Impact Dashboard**  
[`aire-impact-dashboard`](https://github.com/aire-program/aire-impact-dashboard)  
A Streamlit + Plotly dashboard that models institutional AI literacy analytics, readiness indicators, and program KPIs using a robust synthetic dataset and a transparent data schema.

### **Applied AI Literacy Hub (external organization)**  
Public site and microcourse repositories hosted within the [Applied AI Literacy](https://github.com/applied-ai-literacy) organization. The Hub provides the pedagogical foundation that AIRE’s Sandbox and Dashboard extend through research workflows and program analytics.

## Purpose and Scope

The AIRE Program is designed to:

- Support responsible AI experimentation in teaching, research, and academic operations  
- Provide governance-aligned patterns for documentation, reproducibility, and data stewardship  
- Make program impact visible through transparent metrics, dashboards, and learning analytics  
- Offer synthetic-data-based models that other institutions can evaluate and adapt  
- Build shared understanding across faculty, researchers, and leadership via a cohesive ecosystem of tools

All repositories in this organization are released under permissive open-source licenses and use synthetic data exclusively.
