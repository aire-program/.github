# AIRE Program – Applied AI Innovation & Research Enablement

The Applied AI Innovation & Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is an institutional initiative in the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. The program was created to support responsible, evidence-based AI adoption across teaching, learning, and research.

AIRE brings together three complementary pillars:

1. **Applied AI Literacy Hub** – Microcourses, tutorials, and teaching resources that help faculty, staff, and students build practical, discipline-aware AI literacy for teaching and learning.

2. **AI Researcher Developer Sandbox** – A synthetic, reproducible technical environment where researchers can explore AI-enabled workflows, prototype tools, and test governance practices safely.

3. **Applied AI Literacy – Program Impact Dashboard** – An institutional analytics layer that visualizes AI literacy KPIs, adoption patterns, readiness, and forecasting for leadership and governance.

These repositories are public mirrors of projects originally deployed on internal MSU systems (including internal GitLab and web services). They are released here to support transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, and alignment with community standards for responsible AI integration in the education and learning industry.

## Repositories

- **AI Researcher Developer Sandbox**  
  `aire-researcher-sandbox` – Jupyter pipelines, Streamlit tools, synthetic data, and governance templates for AI-enabled research workflows.

- **Applied AI Literacy – Program Impact Dashboard**  
  `aire-impact-dashboard` – Streamlit + Plotly dashboard and KPI engine for evaluating AI literacy programs using fully synthetic data.

- **Applied AI Literacy Hub (external organization)**  
  Public site and microcourse repositories hosted under the `applied-ai-literacy` GitHub organization. The Hub provides the pedagogical and curricular foundation that AIRE’s Sandbox and Dashboard extend with research tooling and analytics.

## Purpose and Scope

The AIRE Program is designed to:

- Lower the barrier to responsible AI experimentation in research and teaching  
- Provide institutionally aligned governance patterns and documentation  
- Make program impact visible through clear metrics and dashboards  
- Share reproducible, synthetic-data-based examples that other institutions can adapt

All repositories in this organization are released under permissive open-source licenses and use synthetic data only. No real institutional data, student data, or research data is included.
