# Applied AI Innovation and Research Enablement (AIRE) Program  
College of Social Science  
Michigan State University

## Overview

The Applied AI Innovation and Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is a coordinated initiative created within the College of Social Science to support responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence across teaching, learning, research, and administrative work. AIRE provides a set of connected resources that help academic units build AI literacy, explore research workflows that incorporate AI, monitor readiness and adoption, and align experimentation with institutional values and governance.

The program was originally deployed within MSU’s secure digital ecosystem, using institutionally supported web services, authenticated analytics environments, and internally hosted research tools. The public GitHub version mirrors the structure and logic of the internal implementation but uses synthetic data and demonstration environments to support transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration with other institutions.

AIRE consists of four complementary components:

1. the AIRE Literacy Hub  
2. the AIRE Researcher Sandbox  
3. the AIRE Impact Dashboard  
4. the AIRE Personalization Layer, which includes the Micro Tutor and the Learner Scorecard

Together, these components create a coordinated model that connects learning resources, hands-on experimentation, individualized feedback, and data-informed analysis.

# AIRE Components

## 1. AIRE Literacy Hub  
**Public mirror:** https://applied-ai-literacy.github.io/hub/

**Purpose:** Provide modular and accessible resources that build foundational AI fluency.

The AIRE Literacy Hub brings together short tutorials, guided examples, and responsible-use materials that support faculty, staff, students, and researchers. Resources focus on:

- core principles of generative AI  
- governance-aligned guidance for responsible use  
- practical examples using free and openly available tools  
- applications of AI in teaching, research, curriculum development, and administrative practice  

The internal Hub was delivered through MSU’s institutional web services. The public version reflects the same structure, with each tutorial stored in its own repository and presented through a static site to support reuse and adaptation by other institutions.

---

## 2. AIRE Researcher Sandbox  
**Repo:** https://github.com/aire-program/aire-researcher-sandbox

**Purpose:** Provide a safe, structured environment for AI-enhanced research experimentation.

The AIRE Researcher Sandbox contains a curated set of Google Colab–compatible notebooks that demonstrate reproducible AI workflows for academic research. Topics include:

- text preparation and transformation  
- embeddings and semantic search  
- retrieval-augmented generation  
- dataset validation and evaluation  
- workflow patterns for qualitative and quantitative research contexts  

The Sandbox supports researchers who are new to AI methods but bring deep disciplinary expertise. Workflows emphasize clarity, transparency, and responsible data handling.

---

## 3. AIRE Impact Dashboard  
**Repo:** https://github.com/aire-program/aire-impact-dashboard

**Purpose:** Offer leadership data-informed insight into AI readiness, adoption, and engagement across the college.

The Impact Dashboard combines synthetic data and recreated analytical logic to demonstrate patterns the internal dashboard provided during deployment. It includes:

- participation and engagement trends  
- confidence and competency indicators  
- department-level adoption patterns  
- themes from reflections and qualitative responses  
- summary views that support planning and resource allocation  

The internal version drew on institutionally governed datasets. The public version uses synthetic data that mirrors the internal schema and preserves the analytical design while protecting privacy.

# 4. AIRE Personalization Layer  
**Includes the Micro Tutor and the Learner Scorecard**  
**Repos:**  
- Micro Tutor integrated within the Sandbox notebooks  
- Learner Scorecard: https://github.com/aire-program/aire-learner-scorecard

**Purpose:** Provide individualized support, formative feedback, and learner-facing analytics that help users strengthen their AI prompting skills and develop more intentional experimentation habits.

The AIRE Personalization Layer connects individual learning experiences with the research workflows and analytics components of the program. It reflects a growing need in higher education to support personalized learning at scale and incorporates practices commonly used in modern instructional design and learning-support ecosystems.

---

### AIRE Micro Tutor

The Micro Tutor is embedded in the Researcher Sandbox and provides structured, rubric-based feedback on prompts submitted by learners or researchers. It evaluates prompts in four areas:

- clarity  
- context  
- constraints  
- evaluation instructions  

The Micro Tutor is designed to function as a practical coaching tool. Rather than rewriting prompts, it explains what is working, what could be improved, and how changes may affect outcomes. This supports reflective practice and helps learners build foundational competencies in prompt design and AI-supported reasoning. The approach is consistent with feedback models used in instructional design, experiential learning, and skills-based training.

---

### AIRE Learner Scorecard  
**Repo:** https://github.com/aire-program/aire-learner-scorecard

The Learner Scorecard provides an analytics view that helps individuals observe how their prompting skills develop over time. It summarizes:

- changes in prompt-quality scores  
- recurring strengths and weaknesses identified by the Micro Tutor  
- engagement patterns across Sandbox modules  
- recommended areas for future practice  

The Scorecard uses the same telemetry schema employed by the Impact Dashboard. The internal version gave learners and instructors information that supported mentoring, instructional planning, and self-directed growth. The public version recreates these analytical patterns with synthetic data while preserving the underlying structure and logic.

The Personalization Layer connects learning, experimentation, and analytics. It helps individuals receive immediate guidance on their work, understand their progress, and identify next steps. At the program level, it helps instructors and administrators understand broad trends that can inform decisions about training and resource development.
